# Changelog

What changed in the game, newest first. Player-facing changes lead each entry; balance numbers come from
AI-vs-AI runs (see DESIGN.md for the balance log). Add new entries under **Unreleased**.

## Unreleased

- Added this changelog and AGENTS.md (the rule to keep it up to date).

## 2026-09-30

### Assault mode (7fb1b23)
- New mode: attack and defend a base. The host picks Conquest or Assault and which team defends.
- Each defender gets a Command Bunker (3000 hp, MG slit) behind a trench and sandbag line. Direct fire does 25%;
  explosives do their full demolition damage.
- Attackers win by destroying every bunker; defenders win when the 15:00 clock runs out.
- Works 1v1 and with teams (3v3 on Six Fronts gives three bunkers).
- Balance: attackers win 50% (default map) and 61% (River Towns) over 90 AI matches each.
- Fixed: the free bunker counted as a 3-star veteran. Fixed a flaky high-ground test.

### Teams, up to 6 players, Six Fronts map (f0f021b)
- Up to 6 players: 1v1, FFA, 2v2v2, 3v3. The host sets teams; each player picks a faction.
- Teammates share vision, can't shoot each other, hold each other's points and win on combined VP.
- New 150x150 map for 6 players: Six Fronts.
- Built by a parallel session; part of it landed in the faction commit below.

### Faction flavor (ba20177)
- Unique units: USA Ranger Squad (satchel charges), German Tiger (heavy tank, thick front armor, max 1),
  Soviet Conscripts (cheap, Ura! sprint).
- Faction looks drawn in code: helmets, tanks and rocket carriers differ per faction.
- Units answer orders in English, German or Russian (mute with M).
- Balance: faction wins 37/33/30% over 300 AI matches (USSR won 74% before tuning).

### Control groups on Ctrl (d6a7970)
- Ctrl+1-9 sets a group. Fullscreen button claims the number keys from the browser; Shift+1-9 still works.

### Command & readability (3557373)
- Minimap (rotates with the camera), attack-move (G or Ctrl+right-click), F fires one ability by priority.
- Garrison houses; tanks shell houses on right-click; every tank round damages structures.
- Cover behind houses, walls, rubble, hedges and vehicles. Veterancy stars.
- Rocket launcher (Calliope / Panzerwerfer / Katyusha) to break garrisons. Bombing run support.

### Rivers, bridges, destruction (8054969)
- Rivers, fords and bridges; houses collapse to rubble, bridges drop into the river, shells crater the ground,
  tanks crush hedges and walls. New map: River Towns.

### Friend-ready hosting (908fa39)
- start.cmd hosts over Tailscale; the invite link always uses the Tailscale address.
- Ping on the scoreboard; a disconnected player's clock pauses. Ground can dip below level (depressions).

### Elevation and editor tools (622c5c2)
- Hills block sight, high ground aims and sees better, cliffs block movement.
- Map editor: select, move and delete whole structures; raise and lower ground.

### Map editor (8841758)
- In-game editor at /?edit: paint terrain, place spawns and points, save with a password, fairness test.
- The host picks the map in the lobby.

### Directional aiming (0d98796)
- Supports and trench digging: click the center, move the mouse to rotate, click to launch.

### Trenches and smoke barrage (ed58db6)
- Trenches (heavy cover), rifle squads dig them, smoke barrage support.

### HQ bases and off-map support (dc57b9c)
- Visible HQs; recon flight, artillery barrage and strafing run, announced to everyone before they land.

### Retreat, abilities, economy (ce53a70)
- Retreat and reinforce, one ability per unit, flat income with catch-up, center point worth 2x VP.
- Fixed a map bias: the top spawn won 22 of 30 AI matches; spawns are now shuffled.

### AI opponents (6ddb136)
- Add AI players from the lobby. Victory target raised to 1200 VP (matches were ending in 3.5 minutes).

### MVP (a4c2de3)
- Server-authoritative WW2 tactics RTS in the browser: 1v1 and 3-way FFA, rifle / MG / AT gun / tank,
  cover, suppression, line of sight, fog of war, capture points.
